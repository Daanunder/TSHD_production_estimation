    "### Gravity force\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the gravity force of the visor when it is submerged under water, there has to be accounted for the density of the (sea)water. A relative density has to be calculated with the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    F_{g} = m_{visor}*\\rho_{relative}*g \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The gravity force of the visor causes a (+/-) moment on the visor hinge. It's operating point is located at the horizontal and vertical positions $G_{x,v}$ and $G_{y,v}$ with respect to the visor hinge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shear angle\n",
    "\n",
    "The blades/teeth of the visor exert a force on the sand which causes the sand particles to move, changing its initial packed grain structure. Due to this movement the volume of the excavated sand, positioned on the blades, increases because little space is created between the still closely packed sand. The space between the particles is then filled with water and pressure differences occur between the pores, resulting in an increase of the grain stresses and also higher cutting forces. This phenomenon is called dilatancy. An increase of the cutting velocity causes a rise of the pressures in the pores. Eventually this pressure can reach the saturated water vapour pressure and cavitation will occur. For the determination of the shear angle a cavitating process is considered. As a result there has been assumed that there are no pressure difference in the pores and therefore the streamlines have not ot be accounted for. Based on the minimum energy principle an approximation of the shear angle can be determined numerically. This value is depending on the blade angle, the layer thickness ratio, the angle of internal friction and the steel-sand friction angle. The equation is stated below.  \n",

    "### Dimensionless cutting force\n",
    "\n",
    "After the shear angle is determined by the minimal energy principle, the dimensionless cutting forces in the horizontal and vertical direction can be calculated, still assuming that only cavitation occurs. For the horizontal and vertical component of the dimensionless cutting force the following equations are used respectively.\n",

Documentation
============
This is the documentation for an object based module that estimates production of a TSHD dredger based on a simple model. As explained in [the background file](https://github.com/Daanunder/TSHD\_production\_estimation/blob/f6204a9109c82bab55e72d9469810729a406d4d1/Background.ipynb 'Background explanation of the model'). The model calculates the produced mixture density of a jet- and cutting dredger based on the moment balance given a certain velocity. It therefore consists of two parts, the jet production estimation based on Miedema (2019) and the cutting production estimation based on the moment balance of forces. Below is a short description of the setup and methods of the TSHD object and finally some examples of the output.

## Requirements

* Pandas
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* Seaborn

## Initial Setup
One can initiate an object as usual:
```python
tshd = trailing_suction_hopper_dredger()
```

### General parameters
By default the following general parameters are defined, related to the environmental conditions;

```python
self.water_density = 1025 # kg/m3
self.sand_density = 2650 # kg/m3
self.steel_density = 7800 # kg/m3
self.permeability = 1*10**-4 #m/s
self.situ_porosity = 0.4 #m/s
self.internal_friction_angle = 35*np.pi/180 #rad
self.steel_sand_friction_angle = 26*np.pi/180 #rad
self.z_coordinate = 30 #m
```

### TSHD Parameters
For the TSHD vessel and dredging arm general parameters and values related to the blade, the visor and the nozzle/jet are defined by default. Where the 'trailing_veloc' is the upper limit of the velocity range for which the production is estimated. The other parameters are self explanatory, as follows; 
```python
# Ship
self.trailing_veloc = 2 #m/s
self.pipe_diam  = 0.762 #m
self.line_speed = 6 #m/s

```
```python
# Blade parameters
self.blade_lenght = 0.1 #m
self.blade_width = 2
self.blade_angle = 45 * np.pi/180 #rad

```
```python
# Visor parameters
self.visor_width = 4 #m
self.visor_height = 2 #m
self.visor_weight = 5500 #kg
self.visor_hor_radius = 2 #m
self.initial_visor_angle = 20 *np.pi/180 #rad
self.lower_suction_angle = 45 * np.pi/180 #rad

```
```python
# Nozzle Parameters
self.pressure = 1*10**3 #kpa
self.nozzle_diam = 0.0254 #m
self.jet_exit_veloc = 5 #m/s
self.nozzles_drag_head = 16 # - 
```
```python
# Jet parameters
self.vel_width_ratio = 1
self.effective_width_power = 0.8
```
### Model parameters
A few other model specific parameters are defined as follows; 
```python
# Model configuration
self.lower_limit_beta = 5*np.pi/180
self.upper_limit_beta = 90*np.pi/180
```
Where the above limits are required to avoid zero-division errors and enable smooth computation of the non-dimensional cutting forces. The paramters below are, respectively:
* hi_method: The method to calculate the jet depth (both 'CSB' and 'Miedema' are accepted)
* cavitating: A boolean to enable a check for cavitational cutting [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
* nodes: The number of nodes used for the velocity range for which the production is estimated. 
* accuracy: The accuracy limit for the moment force balance iteration

```python
# Misc
self.hi_method = 'Miedema'
self.cavitating = True
self.nodes = 5000
self.accuracy = 10 #Nm
    
```

### Changing parameters 
Everytime a parameter is changed manually the 'reinitiate' function has to be called since implicitly some arguments are defined after initiation of the model instance. As deomonstrated below:
```python
tshd = trailing_suction_hopper_dredger()
tshd.trailing_velocity = 5.0
tshd._reinitiate()
```
### Plot initial model
To plot the configured model, at any time, one can call the function below to plot the configured model for a certain trailing velocity (defined by it's index called **cur_index**).
```python
tshd = trailing_suction_hopper_dredger()
tshd.plot_model()
```

Where the function works as follows:
**tshd.plot\_model(self, cur\_index=None):**
- Creates (2x1) plot of the dredge arm and draghed
- Requires cur_index [Defaults to self.initial_visor_angle]
- Returns **plt.show()**

## Jet Production
For the calculation of the jet production a few functions are called; first the jet depth is calculated based on the defined method, then the jet width, the draghead pressure and the volumentric flow in the pipe are calculated, this gives the mixture density based on the constant volume system of the dredger. All these calculations can be done by calling a single function: 

### Usage
```python
tshd.calculate_jet_production()
```

And subsequently the data can be stored and returned in a DataFrame format by calling the following function: 

```python
tshd.create_jet_production_data()
```

### Functions
The first function **tshd.calculate\_jet\_production** uses the functions below; 

**self.\_calculate_hi\_jet(self, vc=None)**
- Calculates cutting depth
- Requires trailing velocity [Defaults to self.vc\_data]
- Checks self.hi\_method
- Limits data to self.max\_hi
- Returns self.hi\_jet

self.**\_calculate\_jet\_width(self)**
- Calculates cavity width
- limits cavity width to the nozzle distance
- returns jet width

self.**\_calculate\_draghead\_pressure (self, hi=None)**
- Calculates draghead pressure
- Requires limited cutting depth [Defaults to self.hi\_jet]
- Returns self.draghead\_pressure

self.**\_calculate\_Q\_pipe(self)**
- Calculates discharge based on pipe diameter and line speed
- Returns self.q\_pipe

self.**\_calculate\_constant\_volume\_system(self, pressure=None)**
- Calculates the Constant Volume System
- Requires pressure in the draghead [Defaults to self.draghead\_pressure]
- Returns self.cvs

self.**\_calculate\_mixture\_density(self, cvs=None)**
- Calculates the density of the mixture
- Requires constant volume system self.cvs
- Returns self.mixture\_density


## Cutting Production
In order to calculate the cutting production we first set up the moment balance to obtain the actual cutting depth. We do this based on cutting forces and the (relative) gravity force on the visor. Please check [the background file](https://github.com/Daanunder/TSHD\_production\_estimation/blob/f6204a9109c82bab55e72d9469810729a406d4d1/Background.ipynb 'Background explanation of the model') for the theory behind this.

### Usage
#### Calculate initial moment and forces for all velocities
To get a starting point for the iterations, with the aim to obtain the balance angle for every given trailing velocity, we first calculate the forces and moments that would be generated for every velocity given the initially defined visor angle; 

```python
tshd.calculate_forces_and_moments()
```

If we then define the 'switchpoint' as the velocity where the moment as a result of the cutting force exceeds the moment induced by the gravity force - i.e. the velocity at which the visor will come loose from its support, we can inspect the different parameters around this point.

```python
tshd.switch_point = np.argmax(np.where(df['M_res [kNm]']>0, -np.inf, df['M_res [kNm]']))
tshd.df[tshd.switch_point-20:tshd.switch_point+20]
```

#### Run numerical iteration to obtain actual forces and moments and plot iterations
Finally we can 
```python
df = tshd.run_main_iteration(log=False, plot=True)
```

#### Plot model for three velocities
```python
tshd.plot_model(tshd.breakpoint-100)
tshd.plot_model(tshd.breakpoint)
tshd.plot_model(tshd.breakpoint+100)
```

## Total Production
If we then finally want to calculate the total production of the TSHD as follows from the model, we can use a single function to obtain a Dataframe. Next we can also plot the total production versus the jet production only and intercompare between different parameters.

### Usage
#### Create total production data

```python
tshd.create_total_production_data()
```

#### Plot data
We can plot the trailing velocity versus; mixture density, the intrusion depth (jetting, cutting and total), the pressure in the draghead and the constant volume system. 

Also shown is the breakpoint velocity, defined as the velocity at which the total intrusion depth becomes larger than the height of the visor. This means that the complete visor will be used as entrance for the mixture and only the ratio cutting/jetting depth has influence on the mixture density and thus production. 

```python
tshd.plot_production_data()
```

#### Compare influence of different parameters
Finally we can compare the influence of different parameters on the production-velocity curve by plotting the results when different values of a given parameter are defined. Make sure to declare a new object every time, this avoids erroneous result that is not dealt with in this object.

Some examples\*\*; 
```python
# Initial visor angle 
tshd = trailing_suction_hopper_dredger()
tshd.model_comparison('initial_visor_angle', [15\*np.pi/180,60\*np.pi/180], N=5)
```
gives:
['Comparison of initial visor angle']('./initial_visor_angle_comparison.png')

```python
# Effective with power
tshd = trailing_suction_hopper_dredger()
tshd.model_comparison('effective_width_power', [0.5, 0.55, 0.68, 0.79, 1.0], explicit_range=True)

```
gives:
['Comparison of effective width power']('./effective_width_comparison.png')
```python
# Internal friction angle
tshd = trailing_suction_hopper_dredger()
tshd.model_comparison('internal_friction_angle', [26/180*np.pi, 45/180*np.pi], N=20)
```
gives:
['Comparison of internal_friction_angle']('./effective_width_comparison.png')

__\* For the sake of saving myself some time the above estimations were done with only 1000 nodes and an accuracy of 1kNm. That is why they are not as smooth as one might expect.__
